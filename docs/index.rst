   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to KiCad's Python API documentation!
============================================

This is the initial proposal for a high level `KiCad <https://kicad.org>`_. Python API.

Main goals are:

* easy to understand
* everything is documented and tested
* stable

Please note this in initial development. Everything can change, and this is at the moment an inofficial realisation
of this idea (thus unstable 3rd-party software).
